<h2 id="baking">My Baking and Cooking</h2>
<p>I enjoy baking and cooking in my free time. I love creating delicious masterpieces and decorating and plating them beautifully. I prefer to bake, although I do cook.
Some things that I enjoy baking are cookies, pies, bread, and other sweet treats. Here are some of the recipes I made:</p>
<table>
  <th>Recipe I Made</th>
  <th>How it Went</th>
  <th>Picture</th>
  <tr>
    <td>Wheat Bread</td>
    <td>I baked this whole-wheat bread using a family recipe. I halved it since the last time I made it, it made three loaves of bread. 
    I made one loaf of bread this time. I proofed my dough in the oven with a pan of boiling water, which helped it to rise nicely. Then, in the oven, it rose even more.
    When I took my bread out of the oven, it was super huge. I took it out of the pan and let it cool. Sadly, it collapsed in on itself because it was too big. The middle
    of the bread was doughy; it didn't get cooked evenly. The top was nice and crispy though. If I were to make this recipe again, I would half the recipe, and put the 
    dough into two loaf pans.</td>

    width="350px; 100%;" height="400px;" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Apple Pie</td>
    <td>I made this apple pie using a grain-free all-purpose flour blend. I used monkfruit as the sweetener. The crust for the pie was crumbly; it was hard to roll it out
    and transfer it to the pie tin. I suspect this was because of the flour I used. I tried my best, and performed intense pie surgery when needed. While the pie was
    baking, the house filled with such a delicious smell. My family loved the pie, and said it tasted amazing!

    side." width="350px; 100%;" height="400px;" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Strawberry Cupcakes</td>
    <td>I made these delicious keto strawberry cupcakes a while back. I worked super hard on them, and I took my time to make it perfect. The cupcakes turned out amazing,
    and the frosting was absolutely to die for! (Figuratively, hehehe) My family loved these cupcakes.

<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>I love to play video games. Some of my favorite games are Overwatch and Minecraft. I have been playing Overwatch since March of 2021. Some of my favorite characters
to play are D.VA, Symmetra, McCree, Genji, Lucio, Bastion, and Mercy.
</p>
<p>In Minecraft I play both singleplayer and multiplayer. For multiplayer I play on PC using the Java edition. The main server I play on is Hypixel. On it, I play
Bedwars, Murder Mystery, and other small games like party games.
