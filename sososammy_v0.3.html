            <h2>My Journey with Web Dev</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2021 I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a web developer and create my own websites. I started learning HTML in the beginning of
June, around the fourth, and I completed the w3schools tutorial on HTML about two and a half weeks later, around the twenty-second. While I was learning HTML I put
my skills and knowledge to the test, working on v0.1 of my website, <i>SoSoSammy</i>. The first version had pictures, lists, a table, and some navigational links.
My code was messy and a little difficult to read, but I was proud of my work and website that I created all on my own. Check it out here: 
            <a href="C:\Users\s777w\OneDrive\Documents\Coding\Web Dev\sucky site.htm" target="_blank">The first version of the SoSoSammy website</a></p>

            <p>The second version of my website I created after I read through the entire HTML tutorial. This time as I was working I focused on writing cleaner code and using HTML 
elements that make sense with the content of my website. I made my website look cleaner and added in a second page. As I was writing this code, I challenged myself to
not use w3schools.com for help, so that way I could explore different resources. Check out my website here: 
            <a href="C:\Users\s777w\OneDrive\Documents\Coding\Web Dev\SoSoSammy_v0.2\SoSoSammy_v.02.html" target="_blank">The second version of SoSoSammy</a></p>

            <p>Now I am working on v0.3 of my website. I am studying CSS through a tutorial on w3schools. For this website I am continuing focusing on writing better content that
flows better and makes sense, along with adding in a nice and neat style to my website. I plan to finish this version and unveil it on July 14th. (It's currently September.
I haven't finished this version yet, but I will be done with it by Friday, October 1<sup>st</sup>!)</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
            <p>I have many favorite things. I love reading, listening to music, playing the piano, playing video games, being active, enjoying nature, creating artwork, fashion,
and becoming a better person.</p>
            <h3>My Favorite Books</h3>
            <p>Since I enjoy reading, I will share with you some of my favorite books. My favorite genre to read in is sci-fi in fiction books. I am starting to read more 
non-fiction books, and I like reading about personal development and becoming the best version of myself. My favorite books are:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Ender's Game</i> by Orson Scott Card</li>
            <ul><li>This is a sci-fi book that takes place far in the future. An alien species is attacking Earth, and the military is becoming desperate for a strategic commander.
This book follows the point of view of six-year-old Ender Wiggin, who is chosen to go to Battle School to train to become a commander. I love this book because of the 
way it causes you to think deeply, and to see things in ways you had never thought of before.</li></ul>
            <li><i>The Alchemist</i> by Paulo Coelho</li>
            <ul><li>This is a fiction book that takes place in the Eastern part of the world long ago. The story is about a shepherd who travels far in search of his personal 
legend, something that a person is destined to do or become in his or her lifetime. This book has many wonderful power phrases and quotes that help you to think about 
life's meaning.</li></ul>
            <li><i>The Reckoners</i> series by Brandon Sanderson</li>
            <ul><li>This is a sci-fi series that takes place on Earth. There was a giant star that appeared in the sky, later named Calamity, that brought with it powers that 
changed people for the worst. The people who received the powers of Calamity are called Epics. They are greedy and power-driven. David Charleston is a teenager whose 
father was killed by one of the worst Epics, Steelheart. David Charleston seeks revenge on Steelheart, and joins a group of ordinary people called the Reckoners in an 
attempt to get even with Steelheart.</li></ul>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I love music. It holds so much emotion, memories, and feelings with it. I enjoy listening to classical music, musicals, lo-fi, indie, pop, K-LOVE, and certain rock 
music. My favorite bands/singers are Aurora, Muse, Dishwalla, Live, Yanni, and Oh Wonder.</p>
            <p>I play the piano, and I used to play the flute. I am currently working on playing Claire de Lune by Debussy on the piano. It has many flats and some key changes, but 
with consistent effort I can play it. I also am learning Mia &amp; Sebastian's Theme on the piano. It is a super complicated song, and I won't be able to play it all the 
way through for a while. I love it because it is from one of my favorite movies, La La Land.</p>
            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>Another one of my hobbies is playing video games. I play many different video games. Some games I play are Overwatch, Minecraft, Animal Jam, Fall Guys, Fortnite,
and De Blob 2. I play both singleplayer and multiplayer on Minecraft. Some of the servers I play on multiplayer Minecraft are Hypixel, Mineplex, and the Hive. 
            </p>
            <p>I started to play Animal Jam in 2014. Even now that it's 2021, I still enjoy playing Animal Jam every once in a while. Whenever I play Animal Jam I'm hit with a wave
of nostalgia that reminds me of when I was a kid. I would explore the world of Jamaa, create fun outfits on my animals, decorate my den, shop, trade, roleplay, go to 
paries, make buddies, and go on adventures.</p>
            <h3>Being Active</h3>
            <p>I enjoy being active and moving my body. It's funny because I'm writing this as I'm lounging on my couch, not moving at all, except for my fingers. But I promise,
I do enjoy moving my body. I have recently started working out around an hour each day. I started around March of 2021. My workouts consisted of kettlebell swings, bicep
curls, tricep extensions, and occassionally some crunches, push-ups, wall squats, and hamstring stretches.</p>
