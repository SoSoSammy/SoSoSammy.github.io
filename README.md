SoSoSammy version 0.5 is out! Wohoo! ðŸŽŠ ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽŠ

This version completely redesigns version 0.4 and adds lots of new features! I showcase my projects on both the homepage and a separate projects page, I combine my education, work experience, and skills into the home page, I add a certificates and awards section on the home page, and I have a working contact form that uses EmailJS.

I'm super excited about this new version of my website, and I hope you enjoy it!
